Project: Ecotoxicological risk assessments from exposure to heavy metals in ground water of Bangladesh
--------------------------------

* Groups: 6 groups with a maximum of 3 participants each
* **Deadline: 26 March 2017, 23:59**


## Tasks

Each group models spatial variability and interpolates the concentration of the assigned heavy metals in the groundwater of Bangladesh. Subsequently, the interpolated concentrations should be compared with the guideline values for the ecotoxicological risk assessments.


## Heavy metals assignment

* Group 1: Ba, Cd
* Group 2: Co, Cr
* Group 3: Cu, Mo
* Group 4: Ni, Pb
* Group 5: Sn, Tl
* Group 6: V, Zn


## Deliverables

* A complete R-script detailing the choice of variogram model, interpolation method, secondary variables and selected guideline value

* Figures (.tiff format) for fitted variogram model, interpolated concentrations and risk surfaces

* Contributions of group members
